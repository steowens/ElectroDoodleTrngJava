Key to ensuring cryptographic security is the use of a truly random number generator.  With software PRNG's you can never be really quite sure whether or not there is a back door in the code, unless you read every line.  This is why some people are opting for hardware random number generation.

In keeping with the above, I bought an [ElectroDoodle Trng off of Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Number-Generator-TRNG-N1-ElectroDoodle/dp/B07BRWVC5R/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1545423956&sr=8-2&keywords=trng), and they sent it to me along with a link to their defunct website for instructions on how to use.  So I had to figure out how to use it without instructions, this project shows how.

The product is great if you know how to use it, but without instructions it really isn't helpful to have such a device. The support for the TRNG is abysmal, but the hardware seems to work well. Hopefully this project will save you some frustration if you decide to use one of these devices to generate randomness for your encryption needs.
