# ElectroDoodleTrngJava
I bought an [ElectroDoodle Trng off of Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Number-Generator-TRNG-N1-ElectroDoodle/dp/B07BRWVC5R/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1545423956&sr=8-2&keywords=trng), and they sent it to me along with a link to their defunct website for instructions on how to use.  So I had to figure out how to use it without instructions, this project shows how.

The product is great if you know how to use it, but without instructions it sort of stinks when you get it in the mail.  Hopefully this project will save you some frustration.
